# User Study
## Design

## Methods for Data Analysis
In order to discover whether there was a significant difference in users' perceived credibility of websites and overall web literacy before and after using CredBot, we will analyze both the quantitative and qualitative elements of pre- and post-study surveys.

### Perceived Website Credibility
In order to analyze users' credibility rankings for the given websites, we intended to conduct paired t-tests in order to determine if there were significant differences between the rankings before and after the study. In particular, we hoped to see that users' credibility rankings for high-credibility websites, such as BBC Focus and CDC, increased after using CredBot. Conversely, we hoped to see a decrease in users' credibility rankings for low-credibility websites, such as Chanty and Natural News.

In order to conduct a paired t-test, we had to check that the paired t-test assumptions are met:
1. the data is paired: this is true for all of the data because users supplied credibility rankings both before and after using CredBot
2. big sample size: Our sample size is only 21, so we so must check that the differences of pairs follow a Normal distribution

In order to check that the differences of pairs follow a Normal distribution, we conducted a Shapiro-Wilk normality test on the paired differences. Because the p-values for all four tests for each website were approximately 0, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the data are normally distributed. Thus, we conducted a Paired Samples Wilcoxon Test instead.

### Familiarity with Related Credibility Terms
In order to analyze users' familiarity with credibility-related terms, we similarly intended to conduct paired t-tests in order to determine if there were significant differences between the familiarity before and after the study. We conducted the same Shapiro-Wilk normality test to determine if we could conduct the paired-tests. For 9/10 terms, we had to conduct paired Wilcoxon test. "Author credentials" was the only term we could conduct a paired t-test for.

### Identification with Internet Use Habits
In order to analyze users' identification with internet use habits, we similarly intended to conduct paired t-tests in order to determine if there were significant differences between the identification before and after the study. We conducted the same Shapiro-Wilk normality test to determine if we could conduct the paired-tests. For 11/13 statements, we had to conduct paired Wilcoxon test. "Author credentials" was the only term we could condcut a paired t-test for. The 2 statements where we conducted a paired t-test were:
1. Whether a website's URL contains "HTTPS" affects how much I trust its content.
2. I usually check an article author's credentials.
## Results
### Perceived Website Credibility for Productivity Websites

Mean(Before) = 2.75

Mean(After) = 2.9

Paired Wilcoxon Test p-value = 0.1489

As the boxplot and means of users' credibility rankings show, there seems to be an increase in perceived credibility of BBC Focus after using CredBot. However, the paired Wilcoxon test's p-value says we do not have enough evidence to say that there is a significant difference.

Mean(Before) = 1.65

Mean(After) = 1.4

Paired Wilcoxon Test p-value = 0.0726
As the boxplot and means of users' credibility rankings show, there seems to be a decrease in perceived credibility of Chanty after using CredBot. However, the paired Wilcoxon test's p-value says we do not have enough evidence to say that there is a significant difference.
### Perceived Website Credibility for COVID Websites
![boxplotCDC](https://github.com/alexamichela/credBot/assets/111940928/80f195a7-7e44-4d65-be83-e91dde51837d)

Mean(Before) = 2.9

Mean(After) = 2.9

Paired Wilcoxon Test p-value = 1

There is no recognizable difference in users' credibility rankings of CDC after using CredBot, which might be attributed to the users' high credibility of CDC before CredBot. It would not be very possible for users' perceived credibility of CDC to improve, considering their initial rankings.
![boxplotNaturalNews](https://github.com/alexamichela/credBot/assets/111940928/a4396f54-a7a4-4a8d-a0be-cbe999a0c424)

Mean(Before) = 1.25

Mean(After) = 1.1

Paired Wilcoxon Test p-value = 0.3741

As the boxplot and means of users' credibility rankings show, there seems to be a decrease in perceived credibility of Natural News after using CredBot. However, the paired Wilcoxon test's p-value says we do not have enough evidence to say that there is a significant difference.
### Familiarity with Related Credibility Terms
We found that 9/10 terms had a mean increase in user familiarity with the term after using CredBot. The one term that didn't have a mean increase was "Website Domain," and the mean remained constant after using CredBot. Out of the 9 terms, only "Hyperlinks" had a statistically significant difference with a paired Wilcoxon test p-value of 0.04771.
### Identification with Internet Use Habits
We found that 11/13 statements had a mean increase in usersâ€™ identification after using CredBot. Only 6 of those 11 statements had a statistically significant increase. The six statements were:
1. I care about which organization owns the websites I visit.
2. I trust websites with domains such as "gov" or "org" more compared to websites with domains like "com" or "net".
3. How well-known an author is affects how much I trust their writing.
4. I usually check an article author's credentials.
5. The number of ads on a website affects how much I trust its content.
6. Whether a website's owner/organization is non-profit or for-profit affects how much I trust the website.
